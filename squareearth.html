   <h1> Square Earth </h1>
    <p> Your whole life, you've been living a lie. You've been led to believe that the planet we live on looks like this. <br> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg/1200px-The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg" width=200px> <br> some would have you believe that the Earth looks like this: <br> <img src="https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/flat-earthers.jpg?quality=80&strip=all" width=200px> <br> Well, I've got news for you: They're all wrong. In reality the earth looks like this: <br> <img src="https://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/aGxg7y6_460s.jpg" width=200px> <br> That's right, Not a sphere, not flat, but a cube. Allow me to explain.

   <p style="font: bold 1em Courier, monospace; color: #2b0057; text-align: center">As you can see, the Square Earth model combines the teachings of both the sphere earth and flat earth theories to create a much better theory. <br>Not convinced yet. Well you should be. Why don't you check out the links in the navbar.</p>

<p style="font: bold 1em Courier, monospace; color: #416600; text-align: center"> As you can see, there's obvious reason to believe that the earth is in fact, a cube. So where do we go from here? <br> If the government has been lying to us about this, then what other lies have we been led to believe? <br> obviously, there is only one option. We must overthrow the government and take their classified information. <br> Wake up America.
